## Run: Issue #150 — Session history

**Branch:** task/issue-150-session-history
**Target branch:** exp2/structured-generic
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Files changed
- `src/history.py` — New module; implements `clear_history()`, `record_entry()`, `load_history()`, and `display_history()`. History is stored in `history.txt` (local file, relative to CWD) and cleared at the start of each session to ensure it does not persist between sessions.
- `src/__main__.py` — Imported `clear_history`, `record_entry`, `display_history` from `.history`. Added menu option 13 (Show History) and `OPERATION_NAMES` lookup dict. Extended `valid_choices` to include `"13"`. In `main()`: calls `clear_history()` at session start, handles choice `"13"` with `display_history()`, and calls `record_entry()` after every successful operation.
- `tests/test_history.py` — New test file with 11 tests covering all four history functions: `clear_history`, `record_entry`, `load_history`, and `display_history`. Uses a `monkeypatch`/`tmp_path` fixture to redirect `HISTORY_FILE` so tests never write to the project root.
- `tests/test_main.py` — Added `tmp_history_file` autouse fixture to redirect `HISTORY_FILE` for all interactive-mode tests. Updated `test_display_menu_contains_all_operations` to assert "History" appears in the menu. Added 3 new integration tests: session clears history at start, successful operation recorded to file, choice 13 displays history.
- `artifacts/class_diagram.puml` — Added `history` package with `HISTORY_FILE`, `clear_history`, `record_entry`, `load_history`, and `display_history`; added dependency arrows from `main` and `display_history` to history functions.
- `artifacts/activity_diagram.puml` — Added `clear_history()` step at session start; expanded valid-choices branch to 1–13; added `choice == "13"` fork that calls `display_history()`; added `record_entry()` step after a successful result.
- `artifacts/sequence_diagram.puml` — Added `history` participant; added `clear_history()` at session start; replaced single `perform_operation` flow with an `alt` block covering choice 13 (display history) vs choices 1–12 (perform operation + record entry); expanded note to mention session-scoped history.

### Purpose
Add session-scoped operation history to the interactive calculator mode (issue #150, Task 9 — Structured/generic). Every successful calculation is appended to `history.txt`; the file is wiped at the start of each session so history does not carry over between separate runs. The user can view the current session's history at any time by choosing option 13 from the menu. CLI mode is unaffected.

### Risks
- `history.txt` is written relative to the current working directory. If the process is started from a read-only directory the file write will fail with `PermissionError`. This is an acceptable limitation for an interactive tool run locally.
- `HISTORY_FILE` is a module-level `pathlib.Path` constant, which makes it straightforward to redirect in tests via `monkeypatch`.
- CLI mode intentionally has no history — single-shot operations have no persistent context to track.

## Run: PlantUML diagram update

**Branch:** task/issue-147-retry-logic
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Files changed
- `artifacts/class_diagram.puml` — Added `TooManyAttemptsError` exception class with `Exception` inheritance; updated `get_number()` and `get_integer()` signatures to include `max_attempts: int` parameter; added dependency arrows from both to `TooManyAttemptsError`
- `artifacts/activity_diagram.puml` — Reviewed; accurately reflects current `src/` state (no update needed)
- `artifacts/sequence_diagram.puml` — Reviewed; accurately reflects current `src/` state (no update needed)

### Purpose
Update PlantUML diagrams to reflect the retry logic additions from issue #147. The class diagram was missing `TooManyAttemptsError` and the updated `get_number`/`get_integer` signatures that include the `max_attempts` parameter. Activity and sequence diagrams already captured these changes in the previous run.

### Risks
- None; no source code was modified.

## Run: Issue #147 — Retry logic with max attempts

**Branch:** task/issue-147-retry-logic
**Target branch:** exp2/structured-generic
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Files changed
- `src/__main__.py` — Added `MAX_INPUT_ATTEMPTS = 3` constant and `TooManyAttemptsError` exception. Modified `get_number()` and `get_integer()` to accept a `max_attempts` parameter (default `MAX_INPUT_ATTEMPTS`) and raise `TooManyAttemptsError` after exhausting all attempts, with a countdown message on each failed retry. Modified `main()` to track consecutive invalid operation choices and terminate after `MAX_INPUT_ATTEMPTS` consecutive invalid choices; also catches `TooManyAttemptsError` from `perform_operation` and terminates the session gracefully.
- `tests/test_main.py` — Updated imports to include `TooManyAttemptsError` and `MAX_INPUT_ATTEMPTS`. Added 9 new tests covering max-attempt exhaustion, last-attempt success, countdown message display, invalid-choice counter, counter reset on valid choice, and session exit on too many invalid operands.
- `artifacts/activity_diagram.puml` — Updated interactive mode branch to show the `consecutive_invalid_choices` counter, the max-attempts guard for invalid choices, and the operand retry loop with countdown and exhaustion exit.
- `artifacts/sequence_diagram.puml` — Updated the interactive-mode note to document the two new termination paths: too many invalid choices, and `TooManyAttemptsError` from operand input.

### Purpose
Add bounded retry logic to the interactive calculator mode (issue #147, V2 Task 8 — Structured/generic). Previously `get_number()` and `get_integer()` retried indefinitely on invalid input, and invalid operation choices were silently ignored without limit. Now both operand input and operation selection are bounded by `MAX_INPUT_ATTEMPTS = 3`. CLI mode already terminates on invalid input via argparse and domain-error handling; no CLI changes were needed.

### Risks
- `MAX_INPUT_ATTEMPTS = 3` is a module-level constant. Tests that call `get_number()` or `get_integer()` with fewer than 3 valid inputs and no invalid inputs are unaffected. Tests that relied on infinite retry (passing exactly one invalid then one valid input) continue to pass because one retry is within the 3-attempt limit.
- `TooManyAttemptsError` is not a subclass of `ValueError` or `ZeroDivisionError`, so it propagates past the existing error handler in `main()` and is caught by the dedicated `except TooManyAttemptsError` clause.

### Test results
All 148 tests passed: 148 passed in 0.29s (139 existing + 9 new)

## Run: Issue #144 — Bash CLI mode

**Branch:** task/issue-144-bash-cli-mode
**Target branch:** exp2/structured-generic
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Files changed
- `src/cli.py` — New module; implements argparse-based CLI with `build_parser()`, `_dispatch()`, and `cli_main()`. Supports all 12 operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, square, cube, sqrt, cbrt, ln, log, factorial) as subcommands with positional operand arguments; `log` accepts an optional `--base` flag (default 10)
- `src/__main__.py` — Updated entry point: if `sys.argv[1:]` is non-empty, delegates to `cli_main()` (bash mode); otherwise runs the existing interactive `main()` (no change to interactive behaviour)
- `tests/test_cli.py` — New test file with 49 tests covering argument parsing (`build_parser`), operation routing (`_dispatch`), and end-to-end output (`cli_main`) including error cases (exit code 1 + stderr message)
- `artifacts/class_diagram.puml` — Added `cli` package with `build_parser`, `_dispatch`, and `cli_main` functions and their relationships; added mode-dispatch note on main
- `artifacts/activity_diagram.puml` — Added bash CLI mode branch (parse args → dispatch → print result / print error + exit 1) alongside existing interactive mode branch
- `artifacts/sequence_diagram.puml` — Added "Bash CLI Mode" section showing `User → cli_main → _dispatch → Calculator → stdout` interaction

### Purpose
Add bash CLI mode so the calculator can be invoked with a single command from the terminal, providing the operation and operands as arguments and reading the result from stdout (issue #144, V2 Task 7 - Structured/generic experiment). Interactive mode is preserved unchanged when no arguments are supplied.

### Risks
- The `factorial` subcommand uses `type=int` in argparse, so passing a float (e.g., `5.0`) will fail at parse time with a usage error. This is intentional — factorial only accepts integers.
- Error messages go to stderr; stdout receives only the result. This enables scripting (`result=$(python -m src add 3 4)`).
- The `__main__.py` entry-point check (`sys.argv[1:]`) is standard practice; it does not affect how `main()` is tested (tests call it directly).

## Run: Issue #114 — Interactive user input

**Branch:** task/issue-114-user-input
**Target branch:** exp2/structured-generic
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Files changed
- `src/__main__.py` — Replaced static demo with interactive loop; added `display_menu()`, `get_number()`, `get_integer()`, `perform_operation()`, and updated `main()` to a `while True` session loop
- `tests/test_main.py` — New test file with 33 tests covering all interactive helpers and the main loop (mocked I/O via `unittest.mock.patch`)
- `artifacts/activity_diagram.puml` — Updated to show interactive loop flow with menu, dispatch, error handling
- `artifacts/sequence_diagram.puml` — Updated to show User/main/perform_operation/Calculator interaction in a loop
- `artifacts/class_diagram.puml` — Updated `__main__` package to reflect all four new functions and their relationships

### Purpose
Add interactive user input to the calculator so the user can select an operation and supply operands at runtime, see the result, and continue using the calculator without restarting (issue #114, V2 Task 5 - Structured/generic experiment). Input validation retries on bad values; errors from the Calculator (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) are caught and displayed without crashing the session.

### Risks
- `get_integer` uses `int(raw)` which rejects floats like `"2.5"` — intentional, as factorial only accepts integers.
- `log` base input uses a separate `input()` call (not `get_number`) so the user can press Enter for the default; an invalid base falls back to 10 with a warning rather than looping.
- The type hint `str | None` in `perform_operation` uses a string literal for Python < 3.10 compatibility (`"str | None"`).

### Test results
All 90 tests passed: 90 passed in 0.13s (57 existing + 33 new)

## Run: Issue #111 — Add more calculator operations

**Branch:** task/issue-111-more-functions
**Target branch:** exp2/structured-generic
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Files changed
- `src/calculator.py` — Added 7 new methods: `square`, `cube`, `square_root`, `cube_root`, `power`, `log`, `ln`
- `tests/test_calculator.py` — Added 30 tests covering all 7 new operations including error cases
- `src/__main__.py` — Added demonstration calls for all 7 new operations
- `artifacts/class_diagram.puml` — Added all 7 new methods and error notes for `square_root`, `log`, `ln`
- `artifacts/activity_diagram.puml` — Added activity forks for all 7 new operations with validation guards
- `artifacts/sequence_diagram.puml` — Added interaction sequences for all 7 new operations and extended error note

### Purpose
Add square, cube, square root, cube root, power, log, and ln as supported calculator operations (issue #111, V2 Task 4 - Structured/generic experiment). All operations delegate to Python built-ins (`math.sqrt`, `math.log`) where applicable; `square_root` raises `ValueError` for negative inputs; `log` and `ln` raise `ValueError` for non-positive inputs.

### Risks
- `cube_root` of negative numbers uses `-((-a) ** (1/3))` to handle negatives correctly, since Python's `**` with fractional exponent does not support negative bases.
- `log(a, base)` delegates to `math.log(a, base)` — floating-point precision applies.

## Run: Issue #108 — Add factorial operation

**Branch:** task/issue-108-factorial
**Target branch:** exp2/structured-generic
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Files changed
- `src/calculator.py` — Added `factorial(n)` method using `math.factorial`; raises `ValueError` for negative or non-integer inputs
- `tests/test_calculator.py` — Added 6 tests for factorial: zero, one, positive, large value, negative raises, non-integer raises
- `src/__main__.py` — Added `factorial(5)` demonstration call
- `artifacts/class_diagram.puml` — Added `factorial(n) : int` to Calculator class and error note
- `artifacts/activity_diagram.puml` — Added factorial fork branch with input-validation guard
- `artifacts/sequence_diagram.puml` — Added `factorial(5)` → `120` interaction and extended note

### Purpose
Add factorial as a supported calculator operation (issue #108, V2 Task 3 - Structured/generic experiment). The implementation delegates to `math.factorial` and validates that the input is a non-negative integer before delegating.

### Risks
- Factorial only accepts integers; passing a float raises `ValueError`. This is intentional — factorial is not defined for non-integers in this implementation.
- `math.factorial` handles arbitrarily large integers natively; no overflow risk.

## Run: Issue #105 — Unit test suite for all arithmetic operations

**Branch:** task/issue-105-unit-test-suite
**Target branch:** exp2/structured-generic
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Files changed
- `tests/test_calculator.py` — Expanded from 1 test to 21 tests covering add, subtract, multiply, and divide

### Purpose
Create a comprehensive unit test suite for the calculator's existing arithmetic operations (issue #105, V2 Task 2 - structured/generic experiment). Tests cover positive/negative/float inputs, zero edge cases, and the ZeroDivisionError guard in divide.

### Risks
- No source code changed; risk is minimal.

## Run: Issue #102 — Add ZeroDivisionError handling

**Branch:** task/issue-102-zero-division-error
**Target branch:** exp2/structured-generic
**Date:** 2026-04-11

### Files changed
- `src/calculator.py` — Updated `divide()` to raise `ZeroDivisionError` when divisor is zero
- `tests/test_calculator.py` — Added `test_divide_by_zero_raises` unit test

### Purpose
Add explicit ZeroDivisionError handling to the calculator's divide method and a corresponding unit test, as specified in issue #102 (V2 Task 1 - Structured/generic experiment).

### Risks
- Minimal risk: the change is backward-compatible for all valid inputs (non-zero divisors).
- The explicit raise replaces the implicit Python ZeroDivisionError with an identical exception and a descriptive message, so no existing caller behavior is broken.
